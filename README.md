Repository for Sadhguru video recommendation project

STATUS: [ONGOING]

## TO DO:
1. Update README.md.
2. `from_channel()` method must have consistent schema.

## ON-GOING TASKS:
1. youtube_client.py -> adding `from_channel()` method to retrieve all videos under a channel.
2. chunker.py -> started implementation.
3. nmf.py -> started implementation.
4. zero_shot.py -> started implementation. 

## Notes:
1. Native datastructure handling and compatibility for outputs from youtube_client.py by chunker.py, nmf.py and zeroshot.py.
2. Consistent outputs (in schema) for `from_channel()` and `from_playlists()` methods in youtube_client.py.
